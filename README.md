## Project Name
2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a database for the Fall 2018 semester for SI664. The dataset for the final project is the 2015 Flight Delay and Cancellations. It comes from kaggle.com and was generated by the U.S. Department of Transportationâ€™s (DOT) of Transportation Statistics. Putting this information into a database would allow users to quickly visualize and search for airlines, airports, specific flight paths and even aircraft types that experience the most significant delays.
